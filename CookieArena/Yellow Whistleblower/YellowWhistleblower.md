A Machine Identification Code (MIC), also known as printer steganography, yellow dots, tracking dots, or secret dots, is a digital watermark that certain color laser printers and copiers leave on every printed page, allowing identification of the device which was used to print a document and giving clues to the originator.

Developed by Xerox and Canon in the mid-1980s, its existence became public only in 2004. In 2018, scientists developed privacy software to anonymize prints to support whistleblowers publishing their work.
